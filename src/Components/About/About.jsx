            Abby is a person in New York who makes films, music, and is not the
            same Abby Lee that stars in Dance Moms. She enjoys comedy, and
            offering commentary about many thingsâ€”entertainment, politics, arts
            & culture. Mmm, how fresh! Her laptop is running out of space
            because she has too many random files and Glee songs in the iTunes
            library.
          </p>

            She is proficient in Adobe Premiere, Photoshop, InDesign as well as
            a variety of other computer apps. Technologically, she is very
            sound.
