          Abby is a person in New York who makes films, music, and is not the
          same Abby Lee that stars in Dance Moms. She enjoys comedy, and
          offering commentary about many thingsâ€”entertainment, politics, arts &
          culture. Mmm, how fresh! Her laptop is running out of space because
          she has too many random files and Glee songs in the iTunes library.
        </p>
        <p>
          She is proficient in Adobe Premiere, Photoshop, InDesign as well as a
          variety of other computer apps. Technologically, she is very sound.
